Known Issues and Limitations

This is not a feature complete release. Further updates with features and bug-fixes will be released in future. Please report any issues on our Discord (https://discord.gg/cZWHMaFQdH).

Rearming/Refueling can only be done with engines off (Ng at 0) and door open
Refueling probe does not have a dedicated panel yet - is currently extended using ‘Fuel Boost Pump Right’ switch. A panel will be added later. The probe is considered a ‘fun’ feature. It must be enabled in the mission editor options for the aircraft.
No player controlled or AI gunners are currently available. If they become possible to implement then they will be added.
Aircraft sinks a little into the deck of objects. Suspension code is a PITA; we’re working on it.
Fuel bags don’t always show for other players on spawn - rearming fixes this. Possible DCS issue syncing the initial state of aircraft?
Damage model is simple - more complexity will be added later.

Please understand that I have spent a *lot* of time trying to solve these issues already. I will continue trying to fix them for future updates.
